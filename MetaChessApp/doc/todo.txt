Dump file for a never ending todo list

cooldown dubble check?
 

what to do when 
gray tile debug debug, the the parent of gray tiles are also overmaxfraction
turns per minute is a var from the board
save root in tile


make build script to compile with natives for win, lin and mac, and test them

save letters as hex
START gui, a board where tiles stand for certain game modes (the board is the menu, can be hierarchical) (tutorial, client,server,...)
add a command line itnerface instead, to start certain game modes, server, client, ... using the self-designed letters


simple network game (local)

profile game, optimise !!!
do this by replacing all gltranslate commands by storing the relative translation in a global var



if pieces can be removed from board add gui tile with pices left per type
Implement piece taken: taken piece is set on random tile and locked, player is put in random pawn, locked piece can only be unlocked by pawn
add portal tiles to root tile

min fraction moet hoger voor de speler meer controle te geven, sneller de hold voor move uitschakelen

define exceptions: 2 classes, fatal & non-fatal, all should be added to a log
and use those exceptions to catch unexpected nullpointer exceptions, arrayinedxoutofboudexceptions,...
